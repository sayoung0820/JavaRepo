# Locker storage app

This was hard! lol. I had many issues with the Results class and kinda gave up with fixing the parameters not being called on correctly.
I realize logError and printSummary are not being called correctly. But when I tried to fix it, it caused errors in another class. Took a break and decided to submit then can fix later.


## Followed all the guidelines
- Configurable locker count
- Scanner and print line in one class

## Classes
- Locker: Represents each storage unit
- LockerService: Handles business logic
- Utilities: Shared methods
- Main: User interface
- Results: Logging outcomes
