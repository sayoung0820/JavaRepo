The code shows good separation of concerns with distinct classes for different responsibilities. Each class has a single, clear, responsibility.

**OVERALL:Passed**

Minor Tweaks:

* The service class is calling `Utilities.getIntInput()` directly, which mixes input handling with business logic. In the future, have the Main class (via terminal utilities) handle input and pass values to the service.

* Locker number validation is repeated in multiple methods - could be extracted to a private helper method.
  ```java
  private boolean isValidLockerNumber(int lockerNumber) {
      return lockerNumber >= 1 && lockerNumber <= lockers.length;
  }
  ```

* Results.java, the constructor takes a `success` parameter but doesn't store it.
